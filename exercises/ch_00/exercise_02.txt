Exercise 0.2

What is the probability of drawing two aces in a  row from a deck of 52 cards,
if you reshuffle your first draw back into the deck before making your second
draw?

- 4/52 * 4/52 = 1/169 = 0.59%

What would that probability be if you didn't reshuffle after your first draw?

- 4/52 * 3/51 = 1/221 = 0.45%
